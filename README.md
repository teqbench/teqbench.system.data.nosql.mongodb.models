# Overview
Concrete implementation of the base document found in TradingToolbox.System.Data.NoSql.Models for MongoDb

This is it’s own solution/project separate from TradingToolbox.System.Data.NoSql.MongoDB.Repository because there are instances where do want to reference it but without all the related repository implementation; because of this it drives keeping TradingToolbox.System.Data.NoSql.Models as its own solution/project to keep separate from repository implementation as well.
